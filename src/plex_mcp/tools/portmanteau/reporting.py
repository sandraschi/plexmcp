    """Comprehensive reporting and analytics tool for Plex Media Server.

    PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
    Instead of creating 6 separate tools (one per report type), this tool consolidates related
    reporting operations into a single interface. This design:
    - Prevents tool explosion (6 tools → 1 tool) while maintaining full functionality
    - Improves discoverability by grouping related operations together
    - Reduces cognitive load when working with reporting tasks
    - Enables consistent reporting interface across all operations
    - Follows FastMCP 2.13+ best practices for feature-rich MCP servers

    SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
    - library_stats: Get statistics for a library or all libraries
    - usage_report: Generate usage statistics and viewing patterns
    - content_report: Analyze content distribution and metadata quality
    - user_activity: Report on user activity and engagement
    - performance_report: Server performance metrics and recommendations
    - export_report: Export reports in various formats (JSON, CSV, HTML)

    OPERATIONS DETAIL:

    library_stats: Get library statistics
    - Parameters: library_id (optional, if omitted returns stats for all libraries)
    - Returns: Statistics including item counts, sizes, types, etc.
    - Use when: You need an overview of library contents and sizes

    usage_report: Generate usage statistics
    - Parameters: time_range (optional, e.g., "7d", "30d", "1y"), library_id (optional)
    - Returns: Viewing statistics, popular content, watch time, etc.
    - Use when: Analyzing viewing patterns and popular content

    content_report: Analyze content distribution
    - Parameters: library_id (optional)
    - Returns: Content breakdown by type, genre, year, quality, etc.
    - Use when: Understanding content distribution and metadata quality

    user_activity: Report on user activity
    - Parameters: time_range (optional)
    - Returns: User engagement metrics, active users, viewing habits

    Prerequisites:
    - Plex Media Server running and accessible
    - Valid PLEX_TOKEN environment variable set
    - PLEX_SERVER_URL configured (or defaults to http://localhost:32400)

    Args:
        operation: The reporting operation to perform. Required. Must be one of:
            "library_stats", "usage_report", "content_report", "user_activity",
            "performance_report", "export_report"
        library_id: Optional library ID to generate report for
        time_range: Time range for reports (e.g., "7d", "30d", "1y", "all")
        format: Export format (json, csv, html) - used for export_report
        output_path: Optional file path for exported reports

    Returns:
        Operation-specific result with report data

    Examples:
        # Get library statistics
        plex_reporting("library_stats", library_id="1")

        # Generate usage report for last 30 days
        plex_reporting("usage_report", time_range="30d")

        # Export content report as CSV
        plex_reporting("export_report", format="csv", output_path="/tmp/content_report.csv")

    Errors:
        Common errors and solutions:
        - "PLEX_TOKEN not set": Configure authentication token
        - "Library not found": Verify library_id is correct
        - "Invalid time range": Use format like "7d", "30d", "1y"
