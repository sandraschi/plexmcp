    """Comprehensive search management tool for Plex Media Server.

    PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
    Instead of creating 5 separate tools (one per search operation), this tool consolidates related
    search operations into a single interface. This design:
    - Prevents tool explosion (5 tools → 1 tool) while maintaining full functionality
    - Improves discoverability by grouping related operations together
    - Reduces cognitive load when working with search tasks
    - Enables consistent search interface across all operations
    - Follows FastMCP 2.13+ best practices for feature-rich MCP servers

    SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
    - search: Basic text search across media libraries
    - advanced_search: Complex multi-criteria search with extensive filtering
    - suggest: Get search suggestions/autocomplete based on partial query
    - recent_searches: Retrieve recently performed searches
    - save_search: Save a search query for future reuse

    OPERATIONS DETAIL:

    search: Basic text search
    - Parameters: query (required), library_id (optional), media_type (optional), limit (default: 100)
    - Returns: List of matching media items with basic metadata
    - Use when: You need a simple text search across titles, descriptions, etc.

    advanced_search: Complex multi-criteria search
    - Parameters: All search filters (title, year, genre, actor, director, etc.), sorting options
    - Returns: Paginated results with total count and applied filters
    - Use when: You need precise filtering with multiple criteria

    suggest: Search suggestions/autocomplete
    - Parameters: query (required, partial text), limit (default: 10)
    - Returns: List of suggested search terms or matching items
    - Use when: Building search UI or providing autocomplete functionality

    recent_searches: Get recent search history
    - Parameters: max_recent (default: 10)
    - Returns: List of recently performed searches with timestamps
    - Use when: Showing search history or allowing users to repeat searches

    save_search: Save a search query
    - Parameters: search_name (required), query and filters (required)
    - Returns: Confirmation with saved search details
    - Use when: Users want to save frequently used search queries
