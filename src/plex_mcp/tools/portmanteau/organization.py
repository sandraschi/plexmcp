    """Comprehensive library organization and maintenance operations for Plex Media Server.

    PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
    Instead of creating 5+ separate tools (one per operation), this tool consolidates related
    library organization and maintenance operations into a single interface. This design:
    - Prevents tool explosion (5+ tools → 1 tool) while maintaining full functionality
    - Improves discoverability by grouping related operations together
    - Reduces cognitive load when working with library organization tasks
    - Enables consistent organization interface across all operations
    - Follows FastMCP 2.13+ best practices for feature-rich MCP servers

    SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
    - organize: Organize a library according to best practices
    - analyze: Analyze a library for organization issues
    - clean_bundles: Clean old bundles to free up disk space
    - optimize_database: Optimize the Plex database
