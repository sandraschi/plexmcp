PlexMCP Portmanteau Tools Package

This package contains all portmanteau tools that consolidate related operations
into single, user-friendly interfaces. Each tool uses an `operation` parameter
with Literal types to specify the action to perform.

Portmanteau tools follow the FastMCP 2.13+ standards with:
- Comprehensive multiline docstrings
- AI-friendly error messages
- Proper type hints with Literal operation parameters

NOTE: These tools are being added ALONGSIDE existing individual tools.
Both approaches work simultaneously. Old tools will be deprecated gradually
after thorough testing and user migration.
