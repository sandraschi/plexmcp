    """Comprehensive library management operations for Plex Media Server.

    PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
    Instead of creating 12+ separate tools (one per operation), this tool consolidates related
    library management operations into a single interface. This design:
    - Prevents tool explosion (12+ tools → 1 tool) while maintaining full functionality
    - Improves discoverability by grouping related operations together
    - Reduces cognitive load when working with library management tasks
    - Enables consistent library interface across all operations
    - Follows FastMCP 2.13+ best practices for feature-rich MCP servers
